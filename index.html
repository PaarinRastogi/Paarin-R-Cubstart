                    <p>We created a hypothetical marketing plan for a small touring company based in the midwest to 
                        expand into the domestic and international scene. We created plans for the touring company to expand 
                        into Mt. Rainer in Washington, and multiple areas in Germany. We analyzed data and competitiors to create
                        a strong and effective strategy to maximize growth of the small business

                    <p> We created a marketing plan for a small dining and entertainment company to branch out and explore new markets
                        We decided to implement a whole new style of restaurant associated with the companies name. Our expansions
                        had plans based in Austin Texas, and Sydney Australia. We perfromed market analysis to try and understand what 
                        customers want and what our services can provide to create the most optimal experience for all parties involved.

                    <h3>Fly's Behavioral Experiment</h3>
                    <p>We collected fruit flies from our local classroon and exposed them to different conditions to 
                        study the effects that each had. We decided to vary the type of liquid the flies were given and kept
                        all else constant. We gave water, different concentrations of sugar water, energy drinks, and alcohol to
                        see what would happen. In doing so, we were able to get very interesting results about what happens to them
                        as they ingest these different liquids.
